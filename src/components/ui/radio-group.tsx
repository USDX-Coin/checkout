/**
 * RadioGroup — an exclusive choice. Plain Radix, no motion: a radio has no
 * surface to move, and a dot that springs into place reads as a glitch.
 *
 * ── Arrow keys must MOVE THE CHOICE, not just the focus ──────────────────────
 * That is the WAI-ARIA radio pattern, and it is the whole reason this component
 * replaced the hand-rolled tiles. Radix intends to do it: on focus it calls
 * `.click()` if an arrow key is down. But it learns "an arrow key is down" from
 * a `document.addEventListener('keydown')` registered in an effect, and React
 * delegates its own events at the root container, which is *inside* document.
 * So the whole React chain — roving focus moves focus, focus handler runs — has
 * already finished by the time that document listener fires. The ref is still
 * false, the click never happens, and arrows only ever move focus.
 *
 * The consequence is not cosmetic. In the light theme the focus ring and the
 * selected marker are both maroon, so a keyboard user could arrow onto a
 * different bank, see a maroon ring on it, and pay — while the selected account
 * was still the previous one.
 *
 * Patching only Radix's trigger was not enough — measured in Chromium, the
 * selection then lagged the focus by one press and arrow navigation stopped
 * altogether once a click landed inside the focus handler, because clicking
 * changes which item roving focus considers active. So this component owns the
 * arrow keys outright: it intercepts them in the capture phase, moves focus and
 * selects in one step, and never lets roving focus see them.
 *
 * Everything else is left to Radix: Tab in/out and the roving tabindex still
 * work because we move focus with `.focus()`, and Space and mouse clicks are
 * untouched — they were never broken.
 *
 * Assumes LTR. In an RTL locale left/right would need swapping; the product is
 * Indonesian, and there is no RTL surface to test against yet.
